> # Description 

This project is a responsive e-commerce website. The user can: view information about each product and add / remove products from the cart. The user can needs to login the page to proceed to the checkout.
I styled the landing page with Tailwind CSS and built it with React Js. Also, Tailwind CSS helped with the responsiveness of the website. I created the routes to the other pages with react-router-dom. The entire UI of the project was implemented in the client folder. 
The authentication was impelemented using Firebase and the payment with Stripe. The user needs to athenticate with Firebase before the payment.
The products data were fetched from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapiserver.reactbd.com/products).
