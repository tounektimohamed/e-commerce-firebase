> # Description 

This project is a responsive e-commerce website. The user can: view information about each product, filter products by category, and add / remove products from the cart. 
I styled the landing page with Tailwind CSS and built it with React Js. Also, Tailwind CSS helped with the responsiveness of the website.   
I created the routes to the other pages with react-router-dom.
The products data were fetched from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).
